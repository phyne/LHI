Using the "Manual AP" software on the laptop, the areas that are only being lit by a single projector need to have their images artificially brightened so they match the brightness of the overlap areas being lit by two projectors. Ideally, when no content is displayed (all black image), the level of brightness is uniform across the entire wall.

Once a region is identified as needing black level tuning, follow the steps below:

- launch Manual AP
- goto File -> Open
- navigate to spacetechlv@gmail.com/My Drive/LAS_PJs/, and open the file that corresponds to the projector that needs to be worked on. e.g. W2-107.cfg
- press Connect, and then Reconfigure. This will take a minute or two
- goto the Black Levels tab on the right
- click on palette 1, take a screenshot of the palette using your preferred method and save the image, then press ok
- press Reset
- move corner dots well inside blend area/inner trapezoid using the mouse. look for the colored dots physically on the wall to see where they are
- move the dots slowly outward using WASD and arrow keys until you eliminate underlap entirely
	- the program is finnicky and will glitch out while trying to move the dots INWARD, and you will have to start over from scratch. Move slowly and only move then OUTWARD to prevent this from happening
- favor overlap at the top of the content versus the bottom since eyes are generally on the middle to lower half of the screen
- MORE STEPS

black levels in main projector regions are noticeably brighter during dark sequences with orange/red (fade in of Lion King, Fantasia volcano scene), and darker during dark sequences with blues (Moana)
