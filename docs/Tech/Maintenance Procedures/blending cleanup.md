Using the "Manual AP" software on the laptop, the projector outputs need to be aligned where they overlap with each other. After identifying a blend region that is out of focus/the images from two projectors do not overlap perfectly, follow the steps below:

- launch Manual AP
- goto File -> Open
- navigate to spacetechlv@gmail.com/My Drive/LAS_PJs/, and open the file that corresponds to the projector that needs to be worked on. e.g. W2-107.cfg
	- choosing which of the two projectors to work on can be based on which projector looks to be more wavy or out of alignment, although either may be worked on to fix the blend
- press Connect, and then Reconfigure. This will take a minute or two
